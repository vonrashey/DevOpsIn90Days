# DevOpsIn90Days

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". I started this journey on the 15th of August 2022 and I plan to run to November 30th for 
a complete 90-day romp on spending an hour a day including weekends to get a foundational knowledge across a lot of different areas that make up DevOps.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

The goal is to take 90 days, 1 hour each a day, to tackle over 13 areas of "DevOps" to a foundational knowledge.

This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.

The quickest way to get in touch is going to be via Twitter, my handle is @vonrashey
